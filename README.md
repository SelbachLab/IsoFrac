# IsoFrac
 Proteinfractionation based isoform proteomics. This script collection is the initial basis for Peptide Correlation Profiling as a strategy to extract protein-level information from peptide-centric (bottom-up proteomic) data.

## Proteomics
Code for the analysis of proteomic data. Input are evidence.txt as provided by MaxQuant.

### Original_Scripts
This folder contains the scripts which have been used in the Kedan et al. Manuscript ``An integrated landscape of mRNA and protein isoforms''. The code may not work from scratch, since working directories and paths of additionally required data need to be adjusted. 
### Additional_Data
Preprocessed data required to run Original Scripts.

### IsoFrac_Wrapper_Function
Simplified wrapper function to provide easy processing of peptide correlation profiling data.
